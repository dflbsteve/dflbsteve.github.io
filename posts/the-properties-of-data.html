<h2 id="the-properties-of-data">The Properties of Data</h2>
<h6>Date: 13/03/2024</h6>  
<br>
<p>Before we dive into what data can do, let's get what data is.</p>
<p>Think of data as the stuff you see and interact with online or on your devices—like texts, lists of information (like in spreadsheets), pictures, videos, you name it.</p>
<p>At its core, we're talking about a bunch of 1s and 0s, those little on-off signals, that come together to make up all the info we use and share.</p>
<p>Any bit of info that's been processed for use? That's essentially what data is.<br>
<br></p>
<h3 id="the-cia-of-data">The CIA of Data</h3>
<p>When we talk about keeping data safe, think of it as protecting a treasure trove. There are three key principles, sort of like the golden rules, that help us do just that. Picture them as the guardians of the digital treasure – the CIA.</p>
<p><strong><code>Confidentiality</code></strong> is all about making sure that our digital secrets are only shared with the right people. It’s like whispering a secret to your best friend and knowing it won’t go any further. This is crucial for keeping sensitive info under wraps, whether it’s personal details or trade secrets.</p>
<p><strong><code>Integrity</code></strong> makes sure that the information stays true to its original form – no lies, no alterations. Imagine you write a letter and lock it in a safe; integrity ensures that nobody can tweak your words before the recipient reads it. It’s all about keeping the data real and reliable.</p>
<p><strong><code>Availability</code></strong> ensures that the information is ready and waiting whenever you need it, kind of like having your favourite snacks available 24/7. This is about making sure systems are up and running, so data can be accessed without a hitch, whether for work or play.<br>
<br></p>
<h3 id="the-functional-properties-of-data">The Functional Properties of Data</h3>
<p>Now, onto the fun part – what we can actually do with data. Think of these as the magic tricks up our sleeves, allowing us to manipulate and manage data in clever ways.</p>
<p><strong><code>The Art of Access - Readability</code></strong><br>
Readability lets us look at the data, understand it, and use it without changing a thing. It’s like reading a book at a library; you can absorb all the info without altering the pages.</p>
<p><strong><code>Making Your Mark - Writeability</code></strong><br>
Writeability is our ability to add to or change the data. Picture doodling on a blank canvas or jotting down notes in your diary. It’s all about making your mark and contributing new information.</p>
<p><strong><code>The Seamless Addition - Appendability</code></strong><br>
Ever wanted to add a postscript to a letter without messing up the original message? That’s appendability. It lets us tack on extra bits of data without disrupting what was already there.</p>
<p><strong><code>The Eraser - Deletability</code></strong><br>
Sometimes, we need to get rid of data that’s no longer useful or relevant, and that’s where deletability comes into play. It’s the digital equivalent of using an eraser, clearing space and keeping things tidy.</p>
<p><strong><code>The Clone Machine - Duplicability</code></strong><br>
Ever wished you could clone your favorite teddy bear or a prized comic book? Duplicability in the data world lets us make exact copies of information, useful for backups or spreading information far and wide.</p>
<p><strong><code>The Go-Button - Executability</code></strong><br>
Executability is a bit like having a genie in a lamp; it allows data (or commands) to spring into action, performing tasks or running programs. It’s what happens when you click “play” on a video or run an app on your phone.<br>
<br></p>
<h3 id="why-properties-of-data-matter-for-data-privacy">Why Properties of Data Matter for Data Privacy</h3>
<p>Before we wrap this up, let's dive into why understanding these properties of data is super important for data privacy.</p>
<p>Imagine living in a world where your secrets could be broadcasted on a billboard or where anyone could tamper with your messages before they reach their destination.</p>
<p>Not cool, right? That's where the savvy handling of data properties comes into play, protecting our digital lives.<br>
<br></p>
<h4 id="the-privacy-protectors">The Privacy Protectors</h4>
<p>The CIA trio – confidentiality, integrity, and availability – are like the superheroes of data privacy.</p>
<p>They work behind the scenes to ensure that our personal information stays personal, remains accurate, and is there when we need it.</p>
<p>Without these guardians, our digital identities would be like open books, vulnerable to all sorts of mischief and malice.<br>
<br></p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-functional-properties">The Role of Functional Properties</h4>
<p>Now, let’s talk about those magic tricks – readability, writeability, and the gang.</p>
<p>They might seem like they’re just about doing cool stuff with data, but they play a huge role in privacy, too.</p>
<p>By controlling who can read, write, or delete data, we’re essentially putting up boundaries and saying, “Hey, only the right people can interact with this information.”</p>
<p>It's like having a secret handshake or a door with a lock – only those in the know can get in.<br>
<br></p>
<h4 id="keeping-data-in-check">Keeping Data in Check</h4>
<p>Duplicability and executability also have their parts to play.</p>
<p>Making sure data can be safely copied (hello, backups!) ensures that we don’t lose our precious info to a digital black hole.</p>
<p>And by managing what data or programs can execute, we’re keeping potentially harmful software at bay, protecting our systems from being hijacked.</p>
<p>All these properties work together to maintain a delicate balance. They enable us to enjoy the benefits online like – sharing, learning, and connecting – while keeping our digital selves secure and our private lives private.</p>
<p>It’s about harnessing the power of data without letting it turn against us.<br>
<br></p>
<h3 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h3>
<p>So, understanding the properties of data isn’t just about geeking out over technical details; it’s crucial for protecting our digital identities and ensuring our online interactions are safe and secure.</p>
